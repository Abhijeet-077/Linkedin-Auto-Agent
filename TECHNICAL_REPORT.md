# Technical Report: InfluenceOS

## 1. Architecture Overview

InfluenceOS is a web application with a frontend built using React and a backend powered by FastAPI (Python). The architecture is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

### 1.1. Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It uses modern web development practices, including:

*   **Component-based architecture:** The UI is built using reusable React components.
*   **State management:** `react-query` is used for managing server state, and `useState` and `useContext` are used for local and global state management.
*   **Routing:** `react-router-dom` is used for client-side routing.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, and `shadcn/ui` provides a set of accessible and reusable UI components.

### 1.2. Backend

The backend is a Python-based API built with FastAPI. It is responsible for:

*   **API endpoints:** Providing a RESTful API for the frontend to consume.
*   **Business logic:** Implementing the core business logic of the application.
*   **Database interaction:** Interacting with the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data.
*   **AI integration:** Integrating with third-party AI services like OpenRouter and Hugging Face.

### 1.3. Database

The application uses a PostgreSQL database to store all its data. The database schema is designed to be relational and includes tables for users, content, analytics, and more. `psycopg2-binary` is used as the Python driver for PostgreSQL.

## 2. AI Model Choices

InfluenceOS leverages several AI models to provide its intelligent features.

### 2.1. Content Generation

For content generation, the application uses the OpenRouter API, which provides access to a variety of large language models (LLMs). The primary model used is `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`, which is a powerful and cost-effective model for generating high-quality text.

### 2.2. Image Generation

For image generation, the application uses the Hugging Face Inference API with the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model. This model is capable of generating high-quality images from text prompts.

### 2.3. Intelligent Content Generation

The "intelligent" content generation feature uses a prompt engineering approach to tailor the generated content to the user's profile. The prompt includes information about the user's industry, role, and interests, which helps the LLM to generate more relevant and personalized content.

## 3. Implementation Decisions

Several key implementation decisions were made during the development of InfluenceOS.

### 3.1. Frontend-Backend Separation

The strict separation between the frontend and backend allows for independent development and deployment. The frontend can be developed and tested against a mock API, while the backend can be developed and tested in isolation.

### 3.2. Mock-Driven Development

The frontend was developed using a mock-driven approach. The `api.ts` file includes a comprehensive mock API that simulates the behavior of the backend. This allowed for rapid frontend development without having to wait for the backend to be fully implemented.

### 3.3. Service-Oriented Backend

The backend is structured using a service-oriented architecture. The business logic is encapsulated in service modules (e.g., `user_service.py`, `content_service.py`), which keeps the API endpoints clean and focused on routing.

### 3.4. Asynchronous Operations

The backend makes use of Python's `asyncio` library to perform asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests to third-party APIs. This allows the application to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking.
